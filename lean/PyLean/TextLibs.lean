Text and binary formats, CPython 3.14.7. `Modules/_struct.c` is modelled in
`TextLibs/StructModel.lean`, on the x86-64 LP64 little-endian build the difftest runs on,
with floats as exact bit patterns (`TextLibs/Bits.lean`). `lu_short`, `lu_longlong`,
`lp_longlong` and similar routines are replaced by native ones at start-up on this build,
so only the proofs reach them, not the difftest.
